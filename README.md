# Statistics and Probability Projects
This GitHub repository is a curated collection of my statistics and probability projects, forming a core part of my data science portfolio.
Statistics Projects Repository
Overview
This repository showcases my coursework and projects in statistics and probability, completed as part of my training in data science. It includes a series of analytical exercises and projects aimed at solving real-world problems using statistical methods and data analysis techniques. The primary tools used in these projects are Excel for data manipulation and analysis, and Python (via Jupyter Notebooks) for more in-depth data processing, statistical analysis, and visualization.

Objectives
The main objectives of these projects are to:


Apply fundamental concepts of statistics and probability to analyze datasets.
Demonstrate proficiency in using Excel for statistical analysis, including descriptive statistics, inferential statistics, hypothesis testing, and data visualization.
Utilize Python libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn for advanced data manipulation and visualization.
Draw meaningful conclusions from data to support decision-making processes.

Projects
This repository is organized into several folders, each representing a distinct project or set of exercises focused on specific areas of statistics and probability. Below is a brief overview of some key projects included:



How to Navigate This Repository
Each folder in the repository corresponds to a specific project or exercise set. Inside each folder, you'll find:

A README.md file providing an overview of the project, its objectives, and key findings.
Data files in CSV format or Excel sheets, depending on the project requirements.
Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb) containing detailed analysis, code, comments, and visualizations.
Feel free to explore these projects to understand my approach to solving statistical problems and my proficiency with the tools and techniques used. For any questions or collaborations, please contact me through amanfky@gmail.com
